#Geo-Chat-Tutorial

Welcome to the Geo-Chat-Tutorial GitHub repository! This project combines Python and ChatGPT to demonstrate the execution of geospatial functions in an interactive chat interface. Follow the instructions below to get started.

##Setup

Create a Virtual Environment
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Then, open your terminal and navigate to the project's root directory. Create a virtual environment by running:

`python -m venv venv`

###Activate the Virtual Environment

Activate the virtual environment with the following commands:

####On Windows:

`.\venv\Scripts\activate`
####On macOS and Linux:

`source venv/bin/activate`

##Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages by running:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

##Getting Started

After setting up your environment, you can begin exploring the geospatial functions integrated with ChatGPT in this tutorial. The Python code is designed to be modular and easy to understand, providing a solid foundation for your own projects.
